# Harbinger-of-Eternity-2D-Space-Game
This "game" is abandoned, it is by far not a complete game - just a lot of systems for the actual game. It is made from scratch with SFML, C++ and LUA by three people.

Programmers
  Johannes Winkler
  Julien Saevecke

Graphics
  Waldemar Hoppe
  ! Not all graphics are made by him. A lot of graphics are taken out of the Web for testing purposes !

The Game got made in 1 year for our Highschool "Max-Eyth" in Kassel as a learning performance. Our supervisor was Dipl. Inf. Andreas John at that time. We abandoned it afterwards and never worked at the game again. Sad, I know. We got the full score for it. We never finished that game because developing a whole engine as unexperienced programmers was just too much to handle. Instead we got to the point that we could start to develop the actual game. We have a Ressource-, GUI-, simple Physics-, simple AI- and Entity-Component-System implemented. Even a localization and script system got finished.

In the repo is a whole dedicated document to showcase our whole work. Sadly it is in german.
